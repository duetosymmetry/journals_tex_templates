For authors preparing their manuscripts using LaTeX, MNRAS has its own LaTeX class files which simulate the appearance of the journal page. Authors are encouraged to use these, although papers prepared using other class files can also be accepted.

From June 2015 a major update to this package, version 3.0, has been made available.

The journal class files and documentation are available at the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN) site in this directory. The package consists of a readme.txt file, the class file mnras.cls, a bibliography style file mnras.bst for authors wishing to use BibTeX, and documentation explaining how to use them. A simple template paper is also available.
